    "# Good Coding Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a small guide on *how-to-code*. Although it's quite succint, there are a couple of things you should know:\n",
    " * Remember that the *you* from two months ago does not reply to emails.\n",
    " * Everyone, from beginner to pro, might be able to learn something from this tutorial.\n",
    " * Don't try to be a perfectionist the first time around (there is no need to spend weeks going through documentation).\n",
    " * These are *good enough* practices to ease your code maintenance and collaboration. You'll have a whole career if you find out the *best* practices (if they even exist...).\n",
    " * Follow the KISS principle (Keep it simple, *s’ilvousplait*).\n",
    " * The goal of coding is not to code faster but to code for longer use.\n",
    " * Consistency is king. Even if your approach is not the best, by keeping it consistent people will be able to understand and deal with your code much more easily.\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Coding Style\n",
    "\n",
    "Especially if you are a beginner, using text editors (or IDEs) may help you a lot in the process. Pycharm, for example, gives you easy acces to code predictions and methods' documentation:\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "![Pycharm](images/pycharm.png)\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "Aside from that, the way you structure your code should follow certain guidelines. PEP8 is the official standards for Python. In a nutshell, this standard suggests:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Use either spaces or tabs to indent your code (but be consistent with your choice):\n",
    " \n",
    " ```python\n",
    " def space_indented():\n",
    "       pass\n",
    " ```\n",
    " **Note:** Although using tabs is not the end of the world, mixing tabs and spaces might be, however.\n",
    " \n",
    " * Surround top-level functions and class definitions with two blank lines, while only leaving one line for other methods/functions:\n",
    " \n",
    " ```python\n",
    " # CODE ABOVE\n",
    " \n",
    " class MyClass:\n",
    "     \n",
    "       def __init__(self):\n",
    "           pass\n",
    "         \n",
    " # CODE BELOW\n",
    " ```\n",
    " \n",
    " * Imports should be on top, one per line and in increasing specificity order:\n",
    " \n",
    " ```python\n",
    " import library\n",
    " import library as lb\n",
    " from library import module\n",
    " from library import module_one, module_two\n",
    " ```\n",
    " \n",
    " * String delimiters should not matter, unless you want to avoid manually escaping characters with '\\':\n",
    " \n",
    " ```python\n",
    " print('Teajay is cool.')\n",
    " print(\"Nuno is also cool.\")\n",
    " print(\"Teajay and Nuno's tutorial is super cool.\")\n",
    " print('Backslash in the middle doesn\\'t look good.')\n",
    " ```\n",
    " \n",
    " * White spaces are good when used properly (like after a punctuation mark) but should be avoided when unnecessary:\n",
    " \n",
    " ```python\n",
    " # Good practice\n",
    " spam(ham[1], {eggs: 2})\n",
    " \n",
    " # Bad practice\n",
    " spam( ham[ 1 ], { eggs: 2 } )\n",
    " ```\n",
    " \n",
    " * Do not inline *if*, *for* and *while*:\n",
    " \n",
    " ```python\n",
    " # Good practice\n",
    " if foo == 'blah':\n",
    "       do_blah_thing()\n",
    " else:\n",
    "       do_non_blah_thing()\n",
    " \n",
    " # Bad practice\n",
    " if foo == 'blah': do_blah_thing()\n",
    " else: do_non_blah_thing()\n",
    " ```\n",
    " \n",
    " * Commenting should be used whenever necessary (but it's not always necessary):\n",
    " \n",
    " ```python\n",
    " # Good practice\n",
    " x = x + 1\n",
    " \n",
    " # Bad practice\n",
    " x = x + 1 # Increment by one\n",
    " ```\n",
    " \n",
    " * Naming should obey these simple patterns:\n",
    " \n",
    " ```python\n",
    " # Variables should be named in lower case\n",
    " variable_name = None\n",
    " \n",
    " # Functions should be named like variables\n",
    " def function_name(): pass\n",
    " \n",
    " # Classes should be named in CamelCase\n",
    " class ClassName: pass\n",
    " \n",
    " # Constants should be name in all caps\n",
    " CONSTANT_NAME = None\n",
    " ```\n",
    " \n",
    " * You should stay away from global variables (and assign default parameter values instead):\n",
    " \n",
    " ```python\n",
    " # Good practice\n",
    " def inc(x, step = 1):\n",
    "       return x + step\n",
    "     \n",
    " # Bad practice\n",
    " step = 1\n",
    " def inc(x):\n",
    "       return x + step\n",
    " ```\n",
    " \n",
    " * You should avoid using absolute file paths and use relative paths instead:\n",
    " \n",
    " ```python\n",
    " # Good practice\n",
    " with open('./files/info.txt', 'r') as file:\n",
    "       print(file.read())\n",
    " \n",
    " # Bad practice\n",
    " with open('/home/user/Documents/files/info.txt') as file:\n",
    "       print(file.read())\n",
    " ```\n",
    " * Note that \"./\" refers to current folder/directory, use \"../\" to select the parent direct. \n",
    " <br/><br/>\n",
    " \n",
    " ## 2. Python Tips\n",
    " \n",
    " * Collections library is your friend, while using dictionaries:\n",
    " \n",
    " ```python\n",
    " # Without Collections\n",
    " todo_list = {}\n",
    " if 'ADA' not in todo_list:\n",
    "       todo_list['ADA'] = list([])\n",
    " todo_list['ADA'].append('Homework 2')\n",
    " \n",
    " # With Collections\n",
    " todo_list = collections.defaultdict(list)\n",
    " todo_list['ADA'].todo_list('Homework 2')\n",
    " ```\n",
    " \n",
    " * Collections library is your friend, for counting multiple objects:\n",
    " \n",
    " ```python \n",
    " # Without Collections\n",
    " counter = {}\n",
    " counter['apples'] = 0\n",
    " counter['oranges'] = 0\n",
    " counter['apples'] += 1\n",
    " counter['oranges'] += 1\n",
    " \n",
    "  # With Collections\n",
    " counter = collections.Counter()\n",
    " counter['apples'] += 1\n",
    " counter['oranges'] += 1\n",
    " ```\n",
    " \n",
    " * Reading files should be done with the following construct:\n",
    " \n",
    " ```python\n",
    " # Good practice\n",
    " with open('file', 'r') as file:\n",
    "       print(file.read())\n",
    "       \n",
    " # Bad practice\n",
    " file = open('file', 'r')\n",
    " try:\n",
    "       print(file.read())\n",
    " finally:\n",
    "       file.close()\n",
    " ```\n",
    " \n",
    " **Note:** Using `open(...) as ...` automatically closes the file after the block finishes running.\n",
    " \n",
    " * You can use pickle to store complex objects in memory (saving time when repeating the same operations):\n",
    " \n",
    " ```python\n",
    " import pickle\n",
    " \n",
    " def load_pickle(file_path):\n",
    "       with open(file_path, 'rb') as file:\n",
    "           return pickle.load(file)\n",
    " \n",
    " def save_pickle(result, file_path = 'pickle'):\n",
    "       with open(file_path, 'wb') as file:\n",
    "           pickle.dump(result, file_path)\n",
    " \n",
    " def very_complex_operation():\n",
    "       try:\n",
    "           return load_pickle('pickle')\n",
    "       except (FileNotFoundError, EOFError) as e:\n",
    "           # 30 minute long computation\n",
    "           save_pickle(result)\n",
    "           return result\n",
    " \n",
    " print(very_complex_operation())  # Takes ~30 minutes\n",
    " print(very_complex_operation())  # Takes a couple of seconds\n",
    " ```\n",
    " \n",
    " * String formatting is easy if you know how to do it:\n",
    " \n",
    " ```python\n",
    " # This will convert the integer to string automatically before printing.\n",
    " print(num_of_apples)\n",
    "\n",
    " # This however, will not. \n",
    " print(\"There are \" + num_of_apples + \" apples on the table.\")\n",
    "\n",
    " # You can convert the integers to strings manually, but it's a bad practice.\n",
    " print(\"There are \" + str(num_of apples) + \" apples on the table.\")\n",
    "\n",
    " # Instead, we recommend you to format strings using %\n",
    " print(\"There are %d apples on the table.\" % (num_off_apples))\n",
    " ```\n",
    "\n",
    " **Note:** Use %d for decimals/integers, %f for floats (alternatively %.**x**f to specify a precision of **x**), and %s for strings (or objects with string representations).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Define configuration-related variables at the top of your modules or scripts. This is a data science class, so you are going to process lots of data by reusing the same code - and this will allow you to re-configure it easily:\n",
    "\n",
    " ```python\n",
    " import pandas as pd\n",
    " \n",
    " DATA_PATH = './data/'\n",
    " DEFAULT_ENCODING = 'UTF8'\n",
    " DEFAULT_COMPRESSION = 'gzip'\n",
    " \n",
    " # CODE BELOW\n",
    " ```\n",
    " \n",
    " * Also, you should avoid manually loading every single file you need to process: \n",
    " \n",
    " ```python\n",
    " # Looping through every file in a directory\n",
    " from os import listdir\n",
    " \n",
    " DATA_PATH = './data/'\n",
    " \n",
    " def process_data(path = DATA_PATH):\n",
    "     for file in listdir(path):\n",
    "         do_something(path + file)\n",
    "         \n",
    " # Providing the target files through the command line\n",
    " from argparse import ArgumentParser\n",
    " \n",
    " parser = ArgumentParser()\n",
    " parser.add_argument(\"--filename\", help=\"Name of the file to process\", type = str)\n",
    " args = parser.parse_args()\n",
    " \n",
    " print(args.filename)\n",
    " ```\n",
    " \n",
    " **Note:** An indepth guide can on command line parsing can be found [here](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/argparse.html).\n",
    " \n",
    " <br/><br/>\n",
    " \n",
    " ## 3. Code Organization\n",
    " \n",
    " This part definitely comes naturally with practice so here we simply give you simple pointers to get you started:\n",
    " \n",
    "* Every *.py* file should be solely comprised of functions and/or classes at its top level (and their necessary imports). Any executable code should go into the *main* function:\n",
    " \n",
    " ```python\n",
    " import math\n",
    " \n",
    " def factorial(n):\n",
    "       return math.factorial(n)\n",
    " \n",
    " if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "       print(factorial(3))\n",
    " ```\n",
    " \n",
    "* Use docstring for documenting your code. More than allowing text editors and IDEs to show you this information afterwards, it will make your code more understandeable and maintainable:\n",

    "      \n",
